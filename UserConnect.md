# Connect User Device to the Owncloud Server

When your ownCloud server is ready and available, each team member who needs to connect at least one device to the server, must have the appropriate client application. There are several client versions, which you can find [here](https://owncloud.com/download/#desktop-clients). 

Some Admins create a single location containing one or more of the downloaded clients for users to access. Then, update the client downloads regularly so they are always the latest version. This way, every user can install their client software from a central version.

## Accessing the Web User Interface
Once each user has a downloaded client interface, and you have created the user accounts, the WebUI is available.
