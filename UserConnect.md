# Have Users Connect Devices to the ownCloud Server

When your ownCloud server is ready and available, each team member who needs to connect at least one device to the server, must have the appropriate client application. There are several client versions, which you can find [here](https://owncloud.com/download/#desktop-clients). 

Some Admins create a single location containing one or more of the downloaded clients for users to access. Then, update the client downloads regularly so they always are the latest version. This way, every user can install their client software from a central repository. For information about system requirements, and the latest clients and mobile apps, see [this section](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.3/admin_manual/installation/system_requirements.html). 

## Accessing the Web User Interface

Once you have created the user accounts, and each user has downloaded and installed a client interface, the servier is available through the WebUI. 

To access the openCloud UI, open this URL in your browser:

<http://localhost:8080> 

## What Users can do from the Client Interface

For user information about using the oneCloud desktop client, have users navigate to the [manual](https://doc.owncloud.com/desktop/2.5/). 

Users may find it especially helpful to learn the status icons for synchronization, [shown here](https://doc.owncloud.com/desktop/2.5/navigating.html#).
