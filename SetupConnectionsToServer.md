## Setup User Connections to the Owncloud Server

To create users to use the ownCloud client servers for storage and shared content, you'll want to create user accounts and roles for your organization. 

For a list of topics about several important items to consider for [user tasks](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.3/admin_manual/configuration/user/), read through this section before you create your user accounts. 

Once any user accounts exist, you can see them in the GUI application. From the interface, you can also edit values, change information, or list by groups or other values.
