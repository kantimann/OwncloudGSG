![OwnCloud logo](/Users/kantimann/workspace/RedHat/OwnCloud_RH/OwnCloudLogo.png)

**ownCloud** is the platform you need for file sharing, syncing, cloud collaboration, and data privacy. You'll quickly see how easy ownCloud is to use and, how using ownCloud simplifies managing your digital, data world. 

This guide is truly what it says it is: a simple Getting Started guide, without lots of details (available elsewhere). This presents the minimal content to get your server up and running, and your client users connecting to that server. Many further details are available elsewhere. 

Specifically, this guide describes the following Administrator topics and one important User topic: 


Administrators |  Users 
-------------- |  ------
Install and configure the Owncloud server | N/A
Enable users to connect to the Owncloud server using the server's IP address and port | N/A
Add users accounts so they can access Owncloud | N/A
N/A | Connect to the Owncloud server from your laptop, or any mobile device
 
Since this is a Quick Start guide, which omits numerous details by design, it includes many pointers to where subject details are described.
